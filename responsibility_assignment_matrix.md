# Responsibility Assignment Matrix

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix

List all the people who are relevant to an initative, each person's roles in the organization and also in initiatives.

A popular approach is a RACIO matrix:

  * Responsible: people who do the work to achieve the task.
  * Accountable: the one person ultimately answerable for the task.
  * Consultable: people whose opinions are sought, such as subject matter experts.
  * Informable: people who are kept up-to-date on progress.
  * Omittable: people who are deliberately out of the loop, i.e. not involved.
