Why use ground rules?

* Ground rules help create an environment that is safe and productive for everyone in the group to work.
* Ground rules help define a common set of expectations that reduce misunderstandings and upsets. 


Top two ground rules:

* Mutual respect
* Mutual purpose


Ground rules for people:

* Be kind.
* Be candid.
* Be courteous.
* Be constructive.
* Be creative.
* Be encouraging.
* Be honest.
* Be open-minded.
* Be prepared.
* Be present.
* Be productive.
* Be punctual.
* Be respectful.
* Be thankful.

Ground rules for teams:

* Assume good-faith intentions.
* Try not to distract or annoy your teammates.
* Ask questions if you are confused.
* Test assumptions and inferences.
* All ideas are valid.
* All voices are heard.

Ground rules for discussions:

* Listen actively and attentively.
* Seek debate.
* Speak your mind.
* Disagree in private, and show a united front in public
* Minimize distractions.
* Ask for clarification if you are confused.
* Do not interrupt, unless you are the facilitator.

Dissent:

* Silence = agreement (some teams choose the opposite of this)
* Debate the issue, not the person.
* Critique the ideas, not the people.
* Challenge one another, and do so respectfully.

Safety:

* If you are offended by anything said during discussion, acknowledge it immediately.
* Respect confidentiality
* Consider anything that is said confidential. 

Other:

* Do not offer opinions without supporting evidence.
* Avoid put-downs (even humorous ones).
* Take responsibility for the quality of the discussion.
* Build on one another’s comments; work toward shared understanding.
* Always have your book/readings in front of you.
* Do not monopolize discussion.
* Speak from your own experience, without generalizing.
* Listen with an open mind before you speak
* No side conversations
* Participate fully
* Respect and share air time
* Be brief – share air time
* Speak for yourself, not on behalf of others
* Differences of opinion are natural and useful
* One person talks at a time
* Take responsibility for what you need in the meeting
* Encourage everyone to participate
* Let group know your attendance plans
* Cell phones are off or on silent notification
* Respect confidentiality where appropriate
* Have fun


Ground rules for meetings:

* Start on time, end on time.
* State the agenda, and the objective.
* Share responsibility for the meeting’s effectiveness.
* Remind the group of its own guidelines if necessary.
* Turn off your mobile phone.
* Use your phone, tablet, laptop etc. only for legitimate meeting activities such as note-taking, presenting, facilitating, etc.
* Do not leave a meeting without okaying it with the leader.
* If more than one person is wanting to speak at a time, then raise hands and wait to be called on.
* Do not interrupt when another participant is speaking. (The facilitator can interrupt as needed to support the process.)
* All focus on one conversation; if you need to have a side conversation, take it out of the room.
* We will not call on anyone twice until all those who want to have spoken once.
* There will be no review for those who are late.
* Ask for more information.
* Be specific. 
* Beware assumptions, generalizations, or exaggerations. 
* Use examples when needed to explain what you mean.
* Take responsibility for bringing the discussion to where it most needs to be.* Is there an “undiscussable” issue that’s really at the heart of things?
* What is most important in this discussion?
* Take responsibility for your own feelings and experiences. 
* Use I-statements, such as "I felt so angry when I saw that", rather than You-statements, such as "You made me so angry when you did that."
* Emotional expression is welcome.
* Aggression or personal attacks are not ok and will be halted immediately.
* Avoid name-calling, stereotypes, cheap shots, or jokes at someone’s expense.
* Work toward understanding—you don’t have to agree in order to paraphrase.
* The facilitator can use short stacks (up to 3-4 people), reserving the right to add people in an order other than that in which hands were raised in order to answer direct questions, add people in who are less vocal, or follow a thread of discussion.
* The facilitator has the power to make judgment calls on process, including directing the topic to where they think it most usefully needs to go (after checking in with the group), so that the group does not spend inordinate time talking about what to talk about.
* Share the air time – step up, step back.
* Speak for yourself.
* Common ownership of ideas; don’t use names unless necessary for clarity. (We are here to debate ideas, not personalities.)
* Minimize repetition. 


Simple rules:

Simple rules are short statements that guide interactions and  decision making within the group and across other groups within the organization.  Simple Rules can generalize across many situations, and make values actionable. Simple Rules aim at brining coherence across the organization.

Example: Use every failure as an opportunity to learn.


Ideas For technology teams:

* Time and place of meetings, such as daily scrum, standup, showcase, etc.
* Testing strategy (unit, functional, integration, performance, stress, etc…)
* Build and infrastructure plans (shared responsbilities)
* Team norms (be on time, respect estimates, help when needed, etc…)
* How to address bugs/fires
* Team availability (phone, office hours, attendance)
* Capacity plan for sprints, iterations, deployments, etc.
* No story creep
* Code is *done* when all code tests pass, and the code is deployed to production, and the customer accepts the story.
* Set up early for demo and prepare
* Never ignore anything! (Such as bugs “solving themselves”).
* We never say “no”. We say “sure, just chuck it on the product backlog. It’ll get prioritised later.”
* Make sure everyone gets heard 
* Each sprint must have a goal
* Stay focused on the goal / top stories
* Make sure daily goals are clear (we know the steps we need to take to achieve them)
* We make decisions together
* We email documentation to everyone in the squad
* We need to show what we have done to the business people impacted, not just our product owner (when appropriate)
