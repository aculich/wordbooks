# Demo Glossary

This repository contains demo glossary files for software projects.

For example, we use this glossary with our software consulting clients. This helps us have a shared vocabulary for good communication, and also helps us point to sources for more information about topics.

Suggestions, comments, and pull requests are all welcome.

See the file [software.md](software.md).
