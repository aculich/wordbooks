<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

The Strategic Balanced Scorecard is simple "4 box" approach to business planning. 

The four boxes:

1. Financial Stewardship
2. Internal Processes
3. Extenal Relations
4. Learning & Growth


<h2><a name="how">How to create a Strategic Balanced Scorecard</a></h2>

1. Craft a Strategic Destination Statement.

  * Describe what the organisation is likely to look like at an agreed future date. 

  * In many cases this builds on existing plans, documents, and team knowledge.

  * In practice it is rare to find a pre-existing document that offers the necessary clarity and certainty.

2. Improve the destination statement by using four strategic perspectives.

  * Financial Stewardship. Examples: sales, income, earnings, profit, margins, economic value, shareholder returns, etc.

  * Internal Processes. Examples: business practices, cycle time, company rules and regulations, productivity, efficiency, throughput, etc.

  * External Relations. Examples: how we wish to be perceived by customers, partners, vendors, regulators, the general public, etc. 

  * Learning & Growth. Examples: what needs to happen for all of the above to be sustained and developed in terms of people, processes, products, perceptions, etc.

3. Plan your Objectives and Key Results (OKRs).

  * Describe what needs to be done and achieved in order for the organisation to reach its destination, including each strategic perspective.

  * Use systems thinking to identify cause-and-effect relationships among objectives. Systems thinking helps ensure the objectives are mutually supportive and represent the combined thinking of the team’s high-level perception of the business model.

4. Measure your Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

  * Identify suitable measures for your objectives and key results: construct the measures to support management’s ability to monitor the organisation’s progress towards achievement of its goals.

  * Aim for high-level roll-up measurements. There is more value in a short list of the top measurements than in an exhaustive list of that covers every tiny detail.

5. Brainstorm Initiatives.

  * Initiatives are special projects with a finite start and end date.

  * Iniatives are mapped to strategic objectives, in order to give an indication of the projects and actions that are needed in order to realise the objectives. 

  * Use systems thinking to identify cause-and-effect relationships among initiatives; for example, what do we need to do to achieve the results we expect? 

6. Group work into projects, programs, and portfolios.

  * Projects that are related can be grouped into a "program".

  * Projects and programs that are unrelated can be grouped into a "portfolio".


<h2><a name="why">Why use a Strategic Balanced Scorecard?</a></h2>

Transform an organization's strategic plan into active work.

  * Clarify vision and direction for the four major stakeholder areas.

  * Guide business planners to come up with objectives and key results (OKRs) and key performance indicators (KPIs).

Enable more effective teamwork.

  * Clearly connect strategy formulation to tactical implementation. 

  * Facilitate articulation, communication, and socialization of strategy,objectives, and performance.

Monitor organization performance compared with strategic goals.

  * Provide a balanced view of the organzation's vision, values, performance, and results.
