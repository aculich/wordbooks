# Key Performance Indicator (KPI)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_performance_indicator

KPIs evaluate the success of an organization or of a particular activity in which it engages. 

Businesses can utilize KPIs to establish and monitor progress toward a variety of goals, including lean manufacturing objectives, minority business enterprise and diversity spending, environmental "green" initiatives, cost avoidance programs and low-cost country sourcing targets.


* Can be simply the repeated, periodic achievement of a goal (e.g. zero defects, 10/10 customer satisfaction)
* Can show making progress toward strategic goals.

A very common way to choose KPIs is to apply a management framework such as the balanced scorecard.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) are ways to periodically assess the performances of organizations, business units, and their division, departments and employees. 

The key stages in identifying KPIs are:

* Have a defined process.
* Have requirements for the process.
* Have a quantitative or qualitative measurement of the results and comparison with set goals.
* Investigate variances.
* Adjust processes and/or resources to achieve short-term goals.

KPIs use SMART criteria, which means the measure is:

* Specific
* Measurable
* Achievable
* Relevant
* Timely

KPIs are linked to target values, so that the value of the measure can be assessed as meeting expectations or not.
